## Security Best Practices for Developers

When contributing to the Tetris Game, please adhere to the following security best practices:

### 1. Input Validation and Sanitization

Always validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent common vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, and Command Injection.

### 2. Secure Coding Practices

*   **Avoid Hardcoding Sensitive Information:** Do not hardcode API keys, passwords, or other sensitive information directly in the code.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to prevent information leakage through error messages.
*   **Least Privilege:** Ensure that components and services operate with the minimum necessary permissions.

### 3. Dependency Management

Regularly update project dependencies to their latest versions to benefit from security patches. Use tools like `npm audit` to identify and address known vulnerabilities in dependencies.

### 4. Security Testing

*   **Unit Tests:** Include security-focused test cases in your unit tests.
*   **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify potential security flaws.

### 5. Data Protection

If the Game were to handle any user data in the future, ensure that data is encrypted both in transit and at rest, and that appropriate access controls are in place.
