### Self-Review Report

I have conducted a self-review from the following perspectives and confirmed that there are no issues.

- **[✓] Are the diffs as intended?:** I have compared the results of `gh pr diff` with the implementation plan and confirmed that no unintended changes are included.
- **[✓] Does the implementation meet the requirements of the Issue?:** I have confirmed that all the requirements specified in the Issue are met.
- **[✓] Does it comply with the `GEMINI.md` conventions?:** It complies with the conventions defined in `GEMINI.md`, such as testing, naming rules, and coding style.
- **[✓] Is the code sufficiently readable and maintainable?:** I have added comments to complex logic and named variables and functions so that their responsibilities are clear.
- **[✓] Are there any potential side effects from the changes?:** I have considered the impact of the changes on other parts and confirmed that there are no unintended side effects.
- **[✓] Are there any unplanned file changes?:** I have confirmed that only the files agreed upon in the implementation plan have been changed.
- **[✓] Is the documentation update appropriate?:** I have confirmed that the relevant documents (`README.md`, `docs/*`, etc.) have also been appropriately updated along with the code changes.
