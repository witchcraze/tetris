# Project Overview for Tetris Game

This document defines the overall picture of the Tetris Game project and forms a common understanding among stakeholders.

## 1. Background and Problem

Traditional Tetris games often lack extensibility and modern development practices. This project aims to create a simple yet robust Tetris game that serves as a foundation for future enhancements and demonstrates best practices in TypeScript-based web development.

## 2. Purpose and Goals

The primary purpose of this project is to provide a well-structured, maintainable, and extensible Tetris game implementation. Our goals are:

*   **Educational:** Serve as a learning resource for developers interested in game development with TypeScript and HTML Canvas.
*   **Extensible:** Design the game with modularity in mind, allowing for easy addition of new features, game modes, and customization options.
*   **Performant:** Ensure a smooth and responsive gameplay experience, with ongoing efforts to optimize rendering and game logic.
*   **Maintainable:** Adhere to high coding standards and provide comprehensive documentation to facilitate long-term maintenance.

## 3. Target Users

*   **Players:** Individuals who enjoy playing classic Tetris games.
*   **Developers:** Those looking for a well-structured TypeScript project to learn from or contribute to, especially in the realm of web-based game development.

## 4. Scope

### What the project will do:

*   Implement core Tetris gameplay mechanics (tetromino movement, rotation, line clearing, scoring).
*   Provide a basic graphical interface using HTML Canvas.
*   Manage game state (score, level, game over).
*   Handle user input for game control.
*   Include basic sound effects and background music.
*   Support saving and loading high scores locally.

### What the project will NOT do (initially):

*   Multiplayer functionality.
*   Complex AI opponents.
*   Advanced graphical effects or 3D rendering.
*   Cross-platform native applications (focus on web).

## 5. List of Main Features

*   **Core Gameplay:** Standard Tetris rules, including T-spin, hard drop, and hold functionality.
*   **Scoring System:** Points awarded for line clears, with bonuses for multiple lines and combos.
*   **Level Progression:** Increasing game speed and difficulty as the player progresses.
*   **High Score Tracking:** Local storage-based high score persistence.
*   **Basic UI:** Score display, next tetromino preview, game over screen.
*   **Sound and Music:** In-game sound effects and background music toggling.
*   **Customization (Basic):** Simple options for adjusting game settings.
